                        Auckland is a city that is congested by cars, with approximately 1/3 of the space in the city being devoted to the private automobile in the form of roads, carparks, driveways, and garages. Typically, a private car in Auckland is stationary 96% of the time resulting in inefficient use of space causing pedestrians to become lost in between, with rather limited civic infrastructure as they are not perceived as a priority.

                        The inevitable future of automation is progressing at an advanced rate as the introduction of self-driving cars, in the case of Tesla, being released in New Zealand, this new technology is set to create a major disruption in the private automobile industry, as itâ€™s expected to be adopted by the masses. Along with the re-emergence of a sharing economy in recent years, we see apps such as Airbnb and Uber promoting the concept of shared ownership and shared spaces which will lead to less consumption of existing resources and reduce the population of automobiles in the city.

                        Architecture is an art that combines context, expression, and technology. Therefore, parametric design tools were used, to express the future, designing with new methods, technology, and materials. This project begins its research to investigate and examine a future of adaptive re-use of obsolete buildings, because of a sharing economy. Specifically targeting a section of the Downtown parking building owned by the council.

                        Undertaking site analysis, data collection, research into disruptive innovations and the current growth patterns and future infrastructure demands of Auckland, a hybrid programme of collaborative offices, libraries, an outdoor auditorium, and public open spaces throughout the building were developed. People are shaped by the spaces that they inhabit, therefore, providing a teaching environment to encourage the desire for people of all ages to learn and interact with the future of autonomous technology will create starting point for innovation.
